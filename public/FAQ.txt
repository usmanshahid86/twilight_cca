<FAQ>Twilight Token Lightning Sale Auction (Continuous Clearing Auction)

What is a continuous clearing auction?

 CCA is an auction format where bids and asks are matched continuously, block by block, allowing real-time price discovery and gradual token distribution instead of discrete, single-round events. For every block there is a certain quantity of tokens available, for which a single fair token price, the clearing price, is calculated for. The clearing price carries over and becomes the floor price for the next block, and a new clearing price is calculated. This process continues until the last block, after which the remaining tokens are transferred into a liquidity pool. 

On a high level, what is the flow of the Twilight Token Lightning Sale Auction?

 The high level flow is as follows:
    (1) Initial Bid - From the time the lightning sale auction begins until it ends, you can submit a bid with a maximum budget and price you are genuinely willing to pay, then deposit the full amount (refundable) to the auction smart contract from Uniswap.
    (2) Order Fill - The auction consist of 10 epochs, each consisting of blocks. There is a certain number of tokens available for each block. At the end of each block a clearing price will be finalized based on the cumulative demand. Everyone who placed max bids at or above the average price (avg price = total maximum budget / block token supply) will get to purchase tokens at the same clearing price while those may get no allocation or partial fills.
    (3) Next Block - At the end of each block, anyone who did not get any fills will see their deposits refunded, while those with only partial fills will have the portion of their unfilled bids carried over to the next block.
    (4) Continuous Bid - You can add in as many bids as you like during the auction as long as the bids are above the floor price for that block AND that the auction has not ended.
    (5) Rising Floor Prices - The clearing price for a block becomes the floor price for the next block.
    (6) Post Auction - At the end of the auction, a liquidity pool on Uniswap will be automatically created to allow people to trade their Twilight Token. The Lightning Sale Auction page will host interface for the swap.

How is the clearing price for each block determined?

 At each block, the system aggregates all outstanding bids and available token supply for the block timeframe, finds the price where cumulative demand equals fixed supply, and sets that as the clearing price. All accepted bids pay this uniform clearing price. The end result is that everyone who bid above the average bid will receive full fill on the bids, while those who bid at the average price will at least get partial fill, and those who bid below the average price may not get any fill.

What can I do to increase my chance of getting full allocation for the tokens?

 The best way to get allocation is to put in an honest bid as early as possible at the maximum price you are willing to buy Twilight Tokens. Bidding lower than everyone else will likely result in getting no fills on your bids, while at the same time you wouldn't want to overpay. You won't need to worry about paying more than everyone else because everyone in the same block transactions at the same clearing price, and bidders that come in in later blocks will not be able to buy at a lower price than yours.

What is the Fully Diluted Value (FDV) of the token at the floor price?

 $50M, compared to $7.55B market cap for ZCash (ZEC) and $7.49B for Monero (XMR). 

Where can I participate or see the auction?

<FAQ>Twilight

What is Twilight?

 Twilight is a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on Bitcoin perpetual futures trading with strong privacy features. Unlike regular Bitcoin trading platforms, Twilight offers untraceable Bitcoin positions, enabling traders to open long or short levered positions while keeping trade and profit & loss (PnL) data private. You can try out Twilight at https://staging-frontend.twilight.rest/ or learn more about Twilight at https://quasar-8.gitbook.io/twilight-docs.

What is the status of the protocol?

Twilight's code is now open-sourced, with a public testnet launch planned for December 2025 and mainnet to soon follow. 

Who is behind Twilight?

 Twilight is built by a group of Bitcoinist hackers who believe in the idea that all monetary transactions should be a very personal and private matter. Twilight has raised $6 million from notable investors including Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Lemniscap, Digital Currency Group, Wintermute, and angels like Naval Ravikant and Meltem Demirors. The development team includes experts in privacy tech, with advisors experienced in privacy coins and Zcash ecosystem.



<FAQ>Untraceable Bitcoin

Why is privacy important for Bitcoin trading?

 Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent and traceable, which compromises trader privacy. Twilight addresses this by using advanced cryptographic techniques like QuisQuis-based keys, rotating Bitcoin vaults ("boomerang"), and zero-knowledge proofs (zkOS with bulletproofs). This allows trading activity inside the pool to remain untraceable even though bitcoins flow through traceable addresses.

How does Twilight ensure Bitcoin positions remain untraceable?

 Twilight uses rotating Bitcoin vaults (boomerang) and QuisQuis-based keys to shuffle addresses with every trade. Zero-knowledge proofs (zkOS + bulletproofs) verify transactions without revealing user data. This design keeps trade execution and PnL private even inside a decentralized exchange environment.

Can I earn with my Bitcoins on Twilight?

 Yes, users who hold untraceable Bitcoin in the pool can lend them to earn trading fees. This creates a two-sided market where traders get private leverage and lenders receive yields in Bitcoin.

What differentiates Twilight from traditional limit order books?

 Twilight operates as a Bitcoin-only pool with private perpetual futures trading. Traders open encrypted long or short positions against the spot-priced pool with zero-cost leverage, rather than posting individual limit orders publicly.

Why not create a new private cryptocurrency instead?

 Twilight focuses on Bitcoin itself because Bitcoin is the largest traded derivatives asset and crucial collateral in stablecoins. Providing privacy for Bitcoin perpetuals addresses a significant market need that privacy coins or forks do not.

What technology powers Twilight?

 The stack includes QuisQuis cryptography for privacy without trusted setup, rotating Bitcoin vaults, zkOS for zero-knowledge proofs, and client-side proof generation optimized for speed (30ms) and throughput (up to 1,000 tx/s).
