<FAQ>Twilight Token Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA)

What is a continuous clearing auction?

 It is an auction format where bids and asks are matched continuously, block by block, allowing real-time price discovery and gradual token distribution instead of discrete, single-round events.

What is the high-level flow of the auction?

 The high level flow is as follows:
    (1) Any during the live auction (time will be announced on the Twilight Token Lightning Sale website), you can fill out the maximum budget and price you are genuinely willing to pay and deposit the full amount (refundable) to our auction smart contract.
    (2) At the end of each block a clearing price will be calculated for that block depending on the bidding demand. Folks who bid at or above the average price will get to purchase tokens at the same clearing price while others may get no allocation or partial fills.
    (3) At the end of each block, anyone who did not get any fills will see their deposits refunded.
    (4) You can add in as many bids as you like during any block as long as the bids are above the floor price for that block, and that the auction has not ended.
    (5) At the end of the auction, a liquidity pool on Uniswap will be automatically created to allow people to trade their Twilight Token. 

How is the clearing price for each block determined?

 At each block, the system aggregates all outstanding bids and available token supply for the block timeframe, finds the price where cumulative demand equals fixed supply, and sets that as the clearing price. All accepted bids pay this uniform clearing price. The end result is that everyone who bid above the average bid will receive full fill on the bids, while those who bid at the average price will at least get partial fill, and those who bid below the average price may not get any fill.

What can I do to increase my chance of getting full allocation for the tokens?

 The best and proven way to get allocation is to put in an honest bid for the maximum price you are willing to buy Twilight Tokens. Bidding lower than everyone else will likely result in getting no fills on your bids, while bidding higher than everyone else may result in paying more than you had to. You won't need to worry about buying at higher prices than others because everyone in the same batch buys at the same price, and bidders that come in in later blocks will not be able to buy at a lower price than yours.

What is the Fully Diluted Value (FDV) of the token at the floor price?

 $50M, compared to $7.55B market cap for ZCash (ZEC) and $7.49B for Monero (XMR). 

Where can I participate or see the auction?

<FAQ>Twilight

What is Twilight?

 Twilight is a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on Bitcoin perpetual futures trading with strong privacy features. Unlike regular Bitcoin trading platforms, Twilight offers untraceable Bitcoin positions, enabling traders to open long or short levered positions while keeping trade and profit & loss (PnL) data private.

What is the progress with the protocol?

Twilight's code is open source, with a public testnet launch planned for December 2025 and mainnet targeted for Q1 2026. The platform supports fast client-side proof generation and high transaction throughput up to 1,000 tx/s.

Who is behind Twilight?

 Twilight is built by a group of Bitcoinist hackers who believe in the idea that all monetary transactions should be a very personal and private matter. Twilight has raised $6 million from notable investors including Blockchain Capital, Castle Island Ventures, Lemniscap, Digital Currency Group, Wintermute, and angels like Naval Ravikant and Meltem Demirors. The development team includes experts in privacy tech, with advisors experienced in privacy coins and Zcash ecosystem.



<FAQ>Untraceable Bitcoin

Why is privacy important for Bitcoin trading?

 Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent and traceable, which compromises trader privacy. Twilight addresses this by using advanced cryptographic techniques like QuisQuis-based keys, rotating Bitcoin vaults ("boomerang"), and zero-knowledge proofs (zkOS with bulletproofs). This allows trading activity inside the pool to remain untraceable even though bitcoins flow through traceable addresses.

How does Twilight ensure Bitcoin positions remain untraceable?

 Twilight uses rotating Bitcoin vaults (boomerang) and QuisQuis-based keys to shuffle addresses with every trade. Zero-knowledge proofs (zkOS + bulletproofs) verify transactions without revealing user data. This design keeps trade execution and PnL private even inside a decentralized exchange environment.

Can I earn with my Bitcoins on Twilight?

 Yes, users who hold untraceable Bitcoin in the pool can lend them to earn trading fees. This creates a two-sided market where traders get private leverage and lenders receive yields in Bitcoin.

What differentiates Twilight from traditional limit order books?

 Twilight operates as a Bitcoin-only pool with private perpetual futures trading. Traders open encrypted long or short positions against the spot-priced pool with zero-cost leverage, rather than posting individual limit orders publicly.

Why not create a new private cryptocurrency instead?

 Twilight focuses on Bitcoin itself because Bitcoin is the largest traded derivatives asset and crucial collateral in stablecoins. Providing privacy for Bitcoin perpetuals addresses a significant market need that privacy coins or forks do not.

What technology powers Twilight?

 The stack includes QuisQuis cryptography for privacy without trusted setup, rotating Bitcoin vaults, zkOS for zero-knowledge proofs, and client-side proof generation optimized for speed (30ms) and throughput (up to 1,000 tx/s).
